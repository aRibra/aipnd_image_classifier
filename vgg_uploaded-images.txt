1. All three archs correctly classified the dog image (otterhound).
2. All three archs correctly classified the horizontally flipped dog image (otterhound).
3. Yes. Animal was correctly classified (fox), but object was not for all the models.
4. As far as the dog + animal classification, they all perform on-par. For objects also they are classified as not being 
dogs, but all failed to output the correct object class.

In terms of speed I would consider either alexnet or resnet, but in terms of accuracy will choose vgg arch.
